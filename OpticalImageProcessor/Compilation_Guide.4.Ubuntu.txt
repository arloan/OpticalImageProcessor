brew install numcpp cli11

4. install cmake in case of you don't have it already
sudo apt-get install cmake

brew install cmake

5. compile

cd OpticalImageProcessor
mkdir build
cd build
# for debug build
cmake ../OpticalImageProcessor
# for release build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../OpticalImageProcessor
# build selected build type
cmake --build .

Good luck!
