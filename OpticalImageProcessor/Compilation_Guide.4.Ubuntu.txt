Compilation Guide for Ubuntu Linux


1. clone source code
In your home or other work directory, run command under terminal:

git clone 


2. install library `libimsux`:

git clone
sudo mv libimsux /usr/local/include/

3. install opencv & gdal (Python installation of the 2 library won't work)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev libopencv-dev

3. install library NumCpp & CLI11

i. install & configure linuxbrew (homebrew for Linux)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /home/<YOUR-USER-NAME>/.profile
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

ii. install NumCpp & CLI11
brew install numcpp cli11

4. install cmake in case of you don't have it already
sudo apt-get install cmake
-- or --
brew install cmake

5. compile

cd OpticalImageProcessor
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../OpticalImageProcessor
cmake --build .

In some cases, cmake complains it still cannot find <CLI/CLI.hpp> and/or <gdal_priv.h>,
please modify OpticalImageProcessor/CMakeLists.txt, add the following two lines at proper position:

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/include)
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${GDAL_INCLUDE_DIRS})


Good luck!
